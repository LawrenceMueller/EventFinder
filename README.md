https://eventfinder.vercel.app/

A web application to allow those who want to socialize their dogs a way to create and find events near them. Built using Next.JS for the front end and Strapi on the backend. Complete with register/login flow, JWT token authentication, user policies (so that only a user that made an event can edit or delete it), and an intuitive map that allows users to view an address easily, which leverages Google's geocode API and the Mapbox API.
